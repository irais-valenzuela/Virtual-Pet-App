// Challenge: Virtual Pet

// Create a virtual pet application using React. Users will 
// adopt and take care of a virtual pet, similar to a Tamagotchi. 
// The virtual pet should have various needs and emotions, and 
// users must interact with it to keep it happy and healthy.

// Requirements:

// Use React to build the virtual pet application.
// Implement a virtual pet character with visual representations 
// of needs and emotions (e.g., hunger, happiness, energy).
// Allow users to feed, play with, and take care of the pet to
// meet its needs and maintain its happiness.
// Display feedback to users based on the pet's condition 
// and emotions.
// Include animations and visual cues to represent the pet's 
// well-being.
// Add a timer or real-time aspect to simulate the passage of 
// time and the pet's evolving needs.
// Make it visually engaging and user-friendly.
